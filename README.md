Online Food Ordering Application

The project built aims at playing with the frond end using html, css and a bit of javascript.

The main interesting learning point is that it is possible with javascript to manipulate a dom object and to dynamically change it. Moreover, with CSS it is possible to decorate and make the web app page more attractive and more professional. 

This seems as a nice start for the front end dev, and it helped experimenting and exploring such ideas, in my limited time.

The project is consists of 5 files:

application.css
application1.js
application1.html
login1.css
login1.html
plus the image folder with the food images.
